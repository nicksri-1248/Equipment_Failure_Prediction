## 🔧 Handling Class Imbalance

The dataset has imbalanced classes (failures are rare). This is addressed using:
- **SMOTE**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Focus on F1-Score, Precision, and Recall (not just accuracy)
- **Balanced Sampling**: Only applied to training data to avoid data leakage

## 🏆 Model Selection Criteria

Models are compared based on:
1. **Primary Metric**: F1-Score (balances precision and recall)
2. **Secondary Metrics**: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC
3. **Training Time**: Efficiency consideration
4. **Robustness**: Cross-validation performance

## 💡 Key Insights

- **Ensemble Methods** generally outperform single models
- **Feature Engineering** significantly improves performance
- **Hyperparameter Tuning** is crucial for optimal results
- **SMOTE** helps handle class imbalance effectively

## 📝 Business Recommendations

1. **Deploy Best Model**: Use the top-performing model for production
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Implement continuous prediction system
3. **Preventive Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance based on failure predictions
4. **Feature Monitoring**: Track important features for early warnings
5. **Model Retraining**: Periodically retrain with new data

## 🎯 Expected Results

- **F1-Score**: > 0.85 (for best models)
- **ROC-AUC**: > 0.90 (for ensemble methods)
